## Overview
### Description
Vacation planning app, allows user to input preferences and will curate a vacation to their liking.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity / Social
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Allows users to plan out their vacation using their preferences, and crafting their own experiences
- **Market:** Anyone that likes to travel enjoy this app. Ability to favorite based on interests and categories allows users with unique interests to engage in.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending whether they want to just explore their surroundings on and off the trip. A "stay-cation" is an equal opportunity too.
- **Scope:** We plan to have the app start on the local level maybe even the national level, and then expand globally when we have investors and/or people tht would allow us access to their databases so we can include them.
